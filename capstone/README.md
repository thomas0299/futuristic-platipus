# Predicting water point functionality in Uganda

My name is Thomas Adler and this is my capstone project as part of the Data Science bootcamp at Brainstation (August 2022).

The aim is to predict whether a water point is functioning in Uganda using Machine Learning. This is a classification problem, with the ultimate aim to identify as many non-functioning points as possible. This is to avoid communities not having access to water and enabling public bodies to monitor, improve and repair water points quicker and more efficiently.

The folders are organised in the following fashion:

1. `data` includes raw, downloaded files from original sources (explained in notebooks) as well as outputs from cleaning and modelling steps.


2. `data_dictionary` includes information from all datasets and their intermediate cleaning and merging steps.


3. `documents` includes various research and presentation documents that may provide context to the project.


4. `images` includes files that have been used in notebooks for visualisation purpose.


5. `models` includes dumps from each model, as well as numpy files for ROC curves for each model.


6. `notebooks` includes all code relaed to the project, including all steps of the project. A table of content of these notebooks can be viewed inside the folder.



I am especially thankful to the [Water Point Data Exchange](https://www.waterpointdata.org/), the [Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project](https://acleddata.com/#/dashboard) and the [Ugandan Bureau of Statistics](https://www.ubos.org/) for providing the data for my project. The thorough documentation, ease of use and accessibility of the data made my project possible and enjoyable. If these datasets and this project has been of use to you, consider [donating to the WPDx](https://globalwaterchallenge.networkforgood.com/projects/145424-wpdx-fundraising-page).
